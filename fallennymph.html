        text:  `The city hummed with the usual rush-hour chaos—honking cars, hurried pedestrians, and a skyline swallowed by dark clouds. The air felt dense, heavy, as if the storm was holding its breath. The buildings loomed over the streets, glass and steel reflecting the storm’s wrath. It was just another gloomy evening, but to Cecil, it felt different. Like the world itself was about to crack open. <br><br>
        Cecil had never liked cities. She had come from the quiet, ancient forests, where the trees whispered secrets and the earth pulsed with magic. This place, with its sharp edges and relentless noise, felt suffocating. Every corner, every street seemed to lead her further away from the world she once knew. She didn’t belong here—she never had, not even when she was at her fullest. <br><br>
        Once, Cecil had been a nymph, radiant and powerful, with the ability to shape the elements around her. Now, she was nothing but a shadow of that. The power was gone, her beauty fading, replaced by a human form that felt foreign, awkward. Her fingers, once able to coax the wind or stir the earth, were now as weak as any other mortal's. She could no longer feel the pulse of nature beneath her feet, the warm embrace of the sun on her skin. Instead, she felt cold, disconnected from everything that once made her who she was.
        Her stomach growled, dragging her attention back to the present. She hadn't eaten much today, and the city offered nothing familiar to ease her hunger. Her cloak, frayed from weeks of use, hung heavily around her, offering little protection against the relentless rain that began to fall. She found shelter beneath a convenience store overhang, watching the rain turn the streets into rivers, feeling the wetness seep into her bones. It felt like the storm outside mirrored the one inside her—chaotic, relentless, threatening to drown her.<br><br>       
        She needed to find a place to stay, something that would keep her safe for the night. The city was vast, and she was lost within it. She had been thrown into this world, stripped of everything that made her a nymph, forced to adapt in ways she hadn’t yet figured out. <br><br>       
        As the storm intensified, she stepped out from under the awning, moving toward an alley. The wind howled, the rain slashing at her face. Her cloak clung to her skin, and her hair, once wild and free, now stuck to her back, wet and heavy.<br><br>
        That’s when she saw him. <br><br>
        He stood at the far end of the alley, a figure almost blending with the storm itself. His clothes were soaked, yet he didn’t seem bothered by the downpour. There was something about him—something ancient, something familiar. His dark eyes locked onto hers, and for a split second, she thought she might have imagined him. But no, he was there, real and solid, standing in the middle of the storm like it was nothing.      
        Cecil’s breath caught in her throat. There was something unnerving about him, an unsettling presence that made her feel small, out of place. <br><br>
        She wanted to turn away, to retreat back into the safety of the bustling city streets, but she couldn’t bring herself to move. She could feel her heart racing, and she hated it. She wasn’t supposed to feel vulnerable—not in a world where vulnerability had already cost her everything.
        For a moment, neither of them spoke. The storm raged, but in the space between them, there was a strange stillness, as though the world had paused for just a heartbeat. <br><br>
        “Do you need help?” His voice was quiet, carrying over the wind, but it was the kind of voice that demanded attention, a voice that felt like it had lived for centuries. <br><br>
        Cecil blinked, her instinct to keep her distance kicking in. She had learned long ago to trust no one, especially not here. “I don’t need help,” she replied, the words coming out sharper than she intended. <br><br>
        The man didn’t flinch. He didn’t even seem surprised. He just watched her with those unreadable eyes, and she felt as though he could see straight through her. His lips curled into a faint smile, the kind that didn’t reach his eyes. <br><br>
        The man didn’t flinch. His eyes, rich and warm hazel color, locked onto hers, piercing through the rain. The city around them roared with noise, but in that moment, everything else seemed to fade. It was just them, standing still in the chaos. Cecil’s heart beat faster, but she refused to show it.
        "I said, I don't need help," she snapped, her voice sharp as a blade. <br><br>
        The man took a slow step forward, his wet clothes sticking to him, but he didn’t seem bothered by the storm. He was calm, almost too calm, like the rain was nothing to him. Cecil wanted to move, to get away, but her feet felt rooted to the ground.<br><br>
        He smiled, not a friendly smile, but one that made her skin crawl. “Pride,” he murmured, “a heavy thing to carry in a world that doesn’t care.”<br><br>
        Her breath hitched, but she refused to let him see it. She wasn’t weak, not anymore. “I’m not here for a lesson,” she said, her voice colder now.<br><br>
        He didn’t move, just kept watching her, those dark eyes unblinking. There was something about him, something... ancient. His gaze felt like it could see into her very soul, and for a moment, she wondered if he knew the truth about her.<br><br>
        “Do you even know who I am?” he asked, his voice low, like a secret.<br><br>
        “I don’t care,” she answered quickly, her words like a shield.<br><br>
        His smile didn’t fade. “Yet you stand here, talking to me.” His tone was teasing, like he was toying with her, but there was something more—a quiet pull she couldn’t ignore.<br><br>
        “I don’t need anything from you,” she said, the words stronger this time. She tried to turn, to leave, but he was in her way.<br><br>
        "Are you sure?” he asked, taking a step closer. “This world… it’s not kind to those like you.”<br><br>
        The words stung, though she hated herself for letting them. The city was cold, harsh. She didn’t belong here, not as she was now. The magic she once held, the beauty of her former self—it was all gone.<br><br>
        “I don’t need help,” she said again, but it felt hollow.<br><br>
        For a moment, they stood there in silence, the storm swirling around them, the rain falling like a thousand tiny threads weaving between them. Her chest tightened. The city felt even colder now.<br><br>
        Without warning, his hand shot out, fast as lightning, and caught her arm. The touch was like ice, not painful but... tender. It made her skin burn, her heart race. She wanted to pull away, but his grip was firm, holding her in place.<br><br>
        "Let go of me," she hissed, the words sharp, but her body trembled.<br><br>
        His touch remained gentle, but there was an undeniable strength to it. “You’re lost,” he said softly. “But I can help you find your way. If you’ll let me.”<br><br>
        The words hung in the air, but Cecil couldn’t bring herself to believe them. She’d been abandoned once, cast out. No one would help her. She didn’t need anyone.<br><br>
        With a sudden twist, she pulled free, stepping back into the rain, her breath coming fast. The storm howled, but it wasn’t the only thing that felt unsettled. Something had changed. Something had shifted between them, and she could feel it deep inside her—a soft pull, like a whisper in the wind.<br><br>
        The man didn’t chase her. Instead, he stepped back, watching her as she moved away, his eyes still locked on her. “Don’t forget,” he called after her, his voice carrying over the storm. “I can show you where you belong just call my name— Xandros.”<br><br>
        Cecil didn’t answer. She didn’t want to. But as she disappeared into the night, his words lingered, heavy and full of meaning.`

        text: `Cecil was really angry now. <br><br> 
        Xandros looked at her calmly. After looking at her for a while, he still looked away. “I am sorry.” <br><br>
        These three words thoroughly stabbed Cecil’s heart, and her eyes were covered with a thin frost. “Do you regret it now?” <br><br>
        How could Xandros regret her? What could he regret? Meeting her, loving her across lifetimes—these were the only moments of color in his endless existence. But if it cost Cecil her life, then he… <br><br>
        Cecil’s throat tightened, and her voice trembled with anger, “How much do you look down on me?” <br><br>
        Xandros sighed softly and looked at her very seriously. “No one understands better than me how excellent you are, but there really isn’t enough time now.” <br><br>
        Her belief, her conviction—it was a fortress. One he feared might collapse under the weight of what he couldn’t protect. <br><br>
        Cecil stared at him. “So what? Will you live on if I die?” <br><br>
        Xandros said without hesitation, “I will never live on alone.” <br><br>
        Cecil tugged at his collar and said, “If so, then what are you worrying about? Isn’t it good to live and die together!” Live and die together… If he took these as sweet nothings, Xandros would feel sweet enough to wake up laughing in the middle of the night. But if this really happened, all he thought was, death must never even approach Cecil. <br><br> 
        Whatever happened to himself didn’t matter, but when he thought about how Cecil’s life was in danger, his fear was like a burrowing maggot, gnawing away at his flesh and blood, sucking away his reason, making him unable to think normally, let alone remain calm and steady. He couldn’t bear it the slightest bit, and his mind was full of the idea of “looking for benefits while staying away from harm.” As long as he could protect Cecil, nothing else mattered. <br><br>
        Cecil stared at him and asked, “As long as you're by my side. Does it matter if it hurts?” <br><br>
        Xandros eyebrows tightened, and he looked away “I just want you to live well…” Before he finished, Cecil pushed him away and said, “Go away!” <br><br>
        Xandros was stunned and looked at her. “Agapi—” <br><br>
        Cecil’s lips closed tightly, and her eyes were like frost. “Go back to your realm!” <br><br>
        Xandros didn’t move, but he didn’t say anything else. He just stood there, his eyes drooping slightly. <br><br>
        Seeing him like this, Cecil had to express her anger, and she said in a cold voice, “Are you going to go or not?” <br><br>
        Xandros was silent, but he refused to move a step.`
