        text:  `The evening was supposed to be perfect—soft lights, laughter, and promises of forever. That was how Ria had pictured Jason's birthday party. Instead, it was a disaster.
<br><br>
She stood there, rooted to the spot in the middle of the garden, surrounded by an audience that included her classmates and Jason's new girlfriend. "I just feel like we've outgrown each other, you know?" Jason's tone was so casual, so unaffected, as if they hadn’t spent three years together.
<br><br>
"Outgrown?" Ria's voice cracked, the word tasting like betrayal on her tongue. "Is that what you're calling cheating now?"
<br><br>
Gasps echoed around her, but Jason just sighed, the picture of exasperation. "Come on, Ria. Let's not make this ugly."
<br><br>
It already was. Ugly, humiliating, and completely public. Ria swallowed hard, her eyes stinging with unshed tears. She wanted to fight, but what was the point? He'd moved on—probably months ago. And now, her classmates whispered, pitying looks following her as she turned and walked away.
<br><br>
Hours later, curled up on her bed in her tiny dorm room, Ria scrolled aimlessly through her phone. Her roommate, Liv, tried to console her with ice cream and snarky comments about Jason's receding hairline, but nothing helped. The pitying stares from her classmates wouldn’t fade. Worse, her family would find out during the upcoming reunion. Her mom would pull her aside, her aunts would whisper, and her cousins—especially her obnoxious cousin Ava—would gloat.
<br><br>
"I can't go back single," she mumbled.
<br><br>
Liv, perched at the foot of her bed, frowned. "You're joking, right? Screw him. Who cares if you're single?"
<br><br>
Ria sat up, her face set with determination. "I need a boyfriend."
<br><br>
Liv blinked. "Did you hit your head?"
<br><br>
"No, I’m serious. A fake one. Just for the reunion." Her fingers moved quickly, searching online until she stumbled on a service: “Rent-a-Bae: Professional Partners for Any Occasion.”
<br><br>
Liv leaned over her shoulder, reading aloud. “Discreet. Professional. No complications.” She snorted. "Sounds sketchy."
<br><br>
But Ria was already scrolling through profiles. Most of the guys looked like Instagram models—too flashy, too polished—until she landed on Lex.
<br><br>
Lex's profile was sparse: no smiling pictures, no over-the-top poses. Just a guy in a fitted suit, dark hair neatly styled, and a piercing gaze that practically screamed, "Don’t talk to me."
<br><br>
"Too serious," Liv muttered.
<br><br>
"Perfect," Ria said. She clicked "Request," and within hours, she had a confirmation. He’d meet her the next day for a consultation.
<br><br>
The next afternoon, Lex arrived at the café exactly on time. Ria watched him walk in—straight-backed, purposeful, and completely unapproachable. He scanned the room once before his gaze landed on her, and in that instant, she knew: This was not a guy who did small talk.
<br><br>
"Miss Santos?" he asked, voice low and professional.
<br><br>
She nodded, gesturing awkwardly to the seat across from her. "Hi. Uh, yeah. That's me."
<br><br>
Lex sat down, pulling out a notebook. "Let's get this over with. Terms, boundaries, and expectations. You’re hiring me for a weekend event?"
<br><br>
Ria blinked. "Wow, no pleasantries?"
<br><br>
He didn’t even flinch. "Pleasantries waste time."
<br><br>
Ria couldn’t decide if she was annoyed or impressed. "Okay, fine. My family reunion. Two days. You’ll pretend to be my boyfriend. I’ll pay whatever the standard rate is."
<br><br>
"Fine," he said. "Rules: no personal questions. No touching unless it's necessary for the act. And no falling in love."
<br><br>
She nearly choked on her coffee. "Falling in love? You think very highly of yourself."
<br><br>
For the first time, a flicker of something—amusement?—crossed his face. But it vanished as quickly as it came. "It's a standard rule."
<br><br>
"Right. Well, don’t worry about me swooning over you, Mr. Robot."
<br><br>
Lex tilted his head slightly, his expression unreadable. "Anything else?"
<br><br>
"Yeah," Ria said, leaning forward. "You’re gonna need to smile. My family’s not gonna buy this if you look like you’re attending a funeral."
<br><br>
He didn’t respond, just scribbled something in his notebook. "I’ll text you my availability. Make sure to send me the event details by tonight."
<br><br>
And just like that, he stood and left, leaving Ria wondering what the hell she’d just signed up for.`

        title: "Chapter 2",
        text: `The café meeting had left Ria with one thought: Lex was a robot in a human body. Sure, he was good-looking—annoyingly so—but he had the warmth of a freezer. And now, this freezer-man was going to be her boyfriend. Fake boyfriend, she corrected herself.
<br><br>
She spent the next morning fretting over the details. Lex had texted her an address for their first "prep session" that afternoon. It turned out to be a nondescript office space downtown, its gray walls and minimalistic décor screaming efficiency.
<br><br>
Ria stepped inside to find Lex waiting at a small table, flipping through a folder. He looked up briefly, his expression as neutral as ever.
<br><br>
"You’re late," he said.
<br><br>
"It’s three minutes," Ria protested, dropping into the chair opposite him.
<br><br>
"Three minutes is late," he replied, closing the folder with a snap.
<br><br>
Ria groaned, already feeling a headache forming. "So, what’s this ‘prep session’ about? Are we going to practice holding hands or something?"
<br><br>
Lex raised an eyebrow. "If you want this to be convincing, we need to establish a believable backstory, common behaviors, and a consistent narrative. This isn’t a joke."
<br><br>
"Wow, you really know how to kill a mood," Ria muttered, crossing her arms.
<br><br>
Ignoring her, Lex pulled out a notebook and a pen. "First question: how did we meet?"
<br><br>
"Uh, at a party?"
<br><br>
"Too vague. Be specific."
<br><br>
Ria thought for a moment. "Okay, fine. At my friend Liv’s birthday party. You were standing in a corner, looking all broody and mysterious, and I decided to talk to you."
<br><br>
Lex scribbled something down. "And why did I agree to date you?"
<br><br>
Ria smirked. "Because I’m irresistible."
<br><br>
Lex didn’t even glance up. "Try again."
<br><br>
"Ugh, fine. Maybe because you were intrigued by my sparkling personality?"
<br><br>
He set the pen down and looked at her, his expression deadpan. "This isn’t a rom-com. Keep it realistic."
<br><br>
"Okay, Mr. Buzzkill. How about… you thought I was different from other girls? You liked my honesty or whatever."
<br><br>
Lex nodded once and wrote it down.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
An hour later, Ria was exhausted. Who knew fake dating came with so much homework?
<br><br>
"Okay," Lex said, setting down his notebook. "Now we need to work on body language."
<br><br>
"Body language?"
<br><br>
"People in relationships behave a certain way. They lean into each other, they share private jokes, they touch casually. If we don’t do that, your family will know something’s off."
<br><br>
Ria frowned. "Touch casually? Like this?" She reached across the table and poked his arm.
<br><br>
Lex blinked at her, unamused. "No."
<br><br>
"Fine, show me what you mean, Mr. Expert."
<br><br>
With a sigh, Lex stood and moved to her side of the table. He crouched slightly, meeting her eyes. "For example, if we’re sitting together, I might put my hand on your back. Like this."
<br><br>
Ria stiffened as his hand gently rested on the small of her back. His touch was surprisingly warm, and for a moment, she forgot how to breathe.
<br><br>
"Relax," he said, his tone more gentle than usual.
<br><br>
"Easy for you to say," she muttered.
<br><br>
He stepped back, crossing his arms. "You’ll need to get used to this. Otherwise, it’ll look forced."
<br><br>
Ria exhaled sharply, trying to shake off the weird fluttery feeling in her chest. "Fine. Let’s try again."
<br><br>
As they wrapped up the session, Ria realized something: Lex wasn’t as robotic as he seemed. Sure, he was cold and professional, but there was an undercurrent of something else—something she couldn’t quite put her finger on.
<br><br>
"Why do you do this?" she asked suddenly as they packed up.
<br><br>
Lex glanced at her. "Do what?"
<br><br>
"This whole fake boyfriend thing. You don’t exactly seem like the type to enjoy pretending."
<br><br>
He hesitated for a fraction of a second, barely noticeable, before replying. "It pays well."
<br><br>
"That’s it?"
<br><br>
"That’s it."
<br><br>
Ria narrowed her eyes, not entirely convinced, but decided to drop it. For now.
<br><br>
As she walked home that evening, her phone buzzed with a text from Lex:
“Don’t forget to send me your family details—names, personalities, anything I need to know. We meet again tomorrow.”
<br><br>
Ria rolled her eyes but couldn’t suppress a small smile. This was going to be interesting.
`
    },
    {
        title: "Chapter 3",
        text: `The second “prep session” took place in a quiet corner of a local park. Lex had texted her that morning with an address and the instruction to “dress casually but presentable.” Ria had shown up in a floral sundress, her wavy hair pulled into a loose ponytail. Lex, on the other hand, looked like he’d walked straight out of a minimalist fashion catalog—white shirt, dark jeans, and an aura of effortless perfection.
<br><br>
“You’re early this time,” Lex remarked as she approached the picnic table where he was seated, his notebook already open.
<br><br>
“Don’t sound so surprised,” Ria shot back, plopping down across from him. “I can be punctual when I feel like it.”
<br><br>
Lex ignored her comment and gestured for her to sit properly. “We’re going over your family today. Names, dynamics, personalities—everything I need to know to make this believable.”
<br><br>
Ria sighed, pulling out her phone to scroll through her family photos. “Alright, let’s start with my mom, Marianne. She’s... uh, a bit overbearing. Loves to meddle, always has an opinion on everything. She’s the main reason I need you to act convincingly. If she even suspects this is fake, she’ll never let me hear the end of it.”
<br><br>
Lex nodded, jotting notes with quick efficiency.
<br><br>
“Then there’s my dad, Henry,” she continued. “He’s more laid-back, but he’ll definitely be watching you. He has this whole ‘no one is good enough for my daughter’ thing going on.”
<br><br>
“Great,” Lex said flatly. “Anything else?”
<br><br>
“Oh, and my little sister, Mia. She’s fourteen, full of teenage attitude, and way too smart for her own good. She’ll probably try to interrogate you for fun.”
<br><br>
“Charming,” Lex muttered, writing it down.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
Once they’d covered the basics, Lex decided it was time to rehearse.
<br><br>
“Pretend I’m your dad,” he said, leaning back in his seat and fixing her with a serious look. “How would you introduce me?”
<br><br>
Ria blinked. “Wait, we’re role-playing now?”
<br><br>
“Do you have a better way to prepare?”
<br><br>
“No, but—fine.” She straightened up and tried to look confident. “Dad, this is Lex, my boyfriend. He’s... uh...”
<br><br>
Lex raised an eyebrow. “He’s... what?”
<br><br>
“He’s... smart?”
<br><br>
Lex sighed. “Try again. Be natural. If you hesitate like that, your dad will know something’s off.”
<br><br>
Ria groaned. “Fine! Dad, this is Lex, my boyfriend. He’s a data analyst—super boring, I know—but he’s sweet, and he treats me well.”
<br><br>
“Better,” Lex said with a nod.
<br><br>
“Oh, and for the record, you are super boring,” Ria teased, smirking.
<br><br>
Lex didn’t dignify her comment with a response.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
Before the session ended, Lex had one more task: to test how convincing they looked as a couple in public.
<br><br>
“We’ll walk through the park,” he instructed. “Hold my hand, act natural, and try not to look like you’re being forced into it.”
<br><br>
Ria stared at him. “You’re really taking this seriously, huh?”
<br><br>
“Of course,” Lex said coolly. “If I’m going to do this, I’m going to do it well.”
<br><br>
With a dramatic sigh, Ria reached for his hand. “Fine. Let’s do this.”
<br><br>
The first thing she noticed was how warm his hand was—firm but not too tight, steady but not stiff. It felt... surprisingly nice, which annoyed her for some reason.
<br><br>
“You’re squeezing too hard,” Lex said, his voice low and matter-of-fact.
<br><br>
“Oh, sorry, Mr. Professional Fake Boyfriend,” Ria muttered, loosening her grip.
<br><br>
They walked through the park, weaving past joggers and dog walkers. To anyone else, they probably looked like a perfectly normal couple, but Ria couldn’t shake the weird mix of awkwardness and... something else.
<br><br>
At one point, an older woman passing by smiled at them and said, “You two make such a cute couple!”
<br><br>
“Thank you,” Lex replied smoothly, his expression not changing in the slightest.
<br><br>
Ria, on the other hand, turned bright red.
<br><br>
When they finally sat back down at the picnic table, Ria let out a long breath. “Okay, that was weird.”
<br><br>
“Get used to it,” Lex said. “If your family doesn’t think we’re convincing, this whole thing falls apart.”
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
As they packed up to leave, Ria found herself studying Lex. For all his professionalism, there was something oddly vulnerable about him. He was guarded, yes, but not entirely unfeeling.
<br><br>
“Hey,” she said as they walked out of the park. “Do you ever get tired of pretending all the time?”
<br><br>
Lex glanced at her, his expression unreadable. “What makes you think I’m pretending?”
<br><br>
“I don’t know,” she said, shrugging. “You just seem like the kind of person who doesn’t let anyone in.”
<br><br>
He didn’t respond immediately, and for a moment, Ria thought he wasn’t going to answer at all. But then he said, quietly, “Some things are easier to keep to yourself.”
<br><br>
Ria opened her mouth to ask more, but he cut her off. “Focus on your family. That’s what matters.”
<br><br>
And just like that, the wall was back up.
<br><br>
That evening, as Ria lay in bed scrolling through her phone, she couldn’t stop thinking about Lex. For someone so closed-off, he had a way of making her feel... curious.
<br><br>
“Don’t get attached,” she muttered to herself. But deep down, she wasn’t sure it was a promise she could keep.
`
    },
    {
        title: "Chapter 4",
        text: `Ria’s heart pounded as they pulled into her parents’ driveway. The familiar two-story house with its well-manicured lawn and flower beds felt smaller than she remembered, probably because her nerves were magnifying everything.
<br><br>
Beside her, Lex looked annoyingly composed, as if he were attending a business meeting rather than walking into the lion’s den of family scrutiny.
<br><br>
“You’re way too calm,” Ria muttered, smoothing the hem of her dress for the third time.
<br><br>
“Your family doesn’t intimidate me,” Lex replied, shutting off the car engine.
<br><br>
“Yeah, well, wait until you meet my mom.”
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
As they walked up the driveway, the door swung open, revealing Marianne, Ria’s mom, with an expression that could only be described as overjoyed and suspicious.
<br><br>
“Ria! And... this must be Lex,” Marianne said, her eyes scanning him from head to toe like a TSA agent.
<br><br>
“Mom,” Ria said, forcing a smile, “this is my boyfriend, Lex.”
<br><br>
“Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Thompson,” Lex said smoothly, extending a hand. His tone was polite, but not overly warm—just the right balance to keep Marianne intrigued but not suspicious.
<br><br>
Marianne shook his hand, her smile widening. “Well, don’t just stand there! Come in, come in.”
<br><br>
As they entered the house, Ria whispered, “So far, so good.”
<br><br>
Lex replied under his breath, “Don’t jinx it.”
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
In the living room, the rest of the family was waiting. Henry, Ria’s dad, was sitting in his favorite recliner, reading a newspaper. He glanced up as they entered, his eyes narrowing slightly at Lex.
<br><br>
“Dad, this is Lex,” Ria said, her voice a little too cheerful.
<br><br>
Henry stood, his expression unreadable, and shook Lex’s hand firmly. “So, you’re the boyfriend, huh?”
<br><br>
“Yes, sir,” Lex replied, meeting Henry’s gaze without flinching.
<br><br>
“Hmm,” was all Henry said before sitting back down.
<br><br>
Then there was Mia, Ria’s younger sister, sprawled on the couch with her phone. She looked up briefly, her eyes lighting up with mischief.
<br><br>
“Finally! I was starting to think you made him up,” Mia teased.
<br><br>
“Very funny,” Ria shot back.
<br><br>
Mia grinned and turned to Lex. “So, Lex, what’s your deal? How’d you manage to convince my sister to date you?”
<br><br>
“I’m persistent,” Lex said smoothly, his lips twitching into the faintest of smiles.
<br><br>
Ria’s mom clapped her hands, cutting through the tension. “Alright, everyone, let’s move to the dining room! Lunch is ready.”
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
Lunch was a whirlwind of questions.
<br><br>
Marianne wanted to know everything about Lex’s career, hobbies, and family background. Henry asked pointed questions about Lex’s intentions and future plans. Mia, of course, was a wildcard, throwing out random questions like, “If you had to pick a favorite Marvel character, who would it be?”
<br><br>
Through it all, Lex remained calm and composed, answering each question with precision and just enough charm to keep Marianne hooked.
<br><br>
Ria, meanwhile, found herself staring at him in disbelief. He was too good at this. The way he subtly deflected personal questions, the polite yet firm tone he used with her dad—it was like watching a masterclass in deception.
<br><br>
At one point, Marianne asked, “So, how did you two meet?”
<br><br>
Ria froze, realizing they hadn’t rehearsed this part.
<br><br>
But Lex didn’t miss a beat. “We met at a coffee shop. I accidentally took her drink order—it had a name I couldn’t even pronounce. She scolded me for five minutes straight, and I thought, ‘Anyone that passionate about coffee is worth getting to know.’”
<br><br>
The table erupted in laughter, and Ria forced herself to laugh along, even though her heart was racing.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
After lunch, Ria and Lex were helping clear the table when Mia cornered them in the kitchen.
<br><br>
“So,” she said, leaning against the counter, “is this, like, for real?”
<br><br>
Ria nearly dropped a plate. “What are you talking about?”
<br><br>
“Oh, come on,” Mia said, rolling her eyes. “You’re way too awkward around him for this to be a real relationship. Spill it.”
<br><br>
Ria opened her mouth to deny it, but Lex stepped in.
<br><br>
“You’re perceptive,” he said, his tone cool. “But if you want to interrogate someone, maybe try not to blow up their cover in front of the whole family.”
<br><br>
Mia blinked, caught off guard. Then she smirked. “Alright, Mr. Mysterious. I’ll play along—for now.”
<br><br>
As she sauntered out, Ria turned to Lex, her voice low and urgent. “Why didn’t you deny it?”
<br><br>
“Because she’s right,” Lex replied. “You’re too obvious. Work on it.”
<br><br>
Ria glared at him, but before she could argue, Marianne called from the living room, “Ria, Lex, come join us for dessert!”
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
After dessert, the family settled into the living room, chatting and laughing. Ria found herself sitting next to Lex on the couch, their shoulders brushing.
<br><br>
At one point, Mia grabbed her phone and said, “Smile for a picture!”
<br><br>
Before Ria could react, Lex slipped an arm around her shoulders, pulling her closer. The gesture was so casual, so natural, that it left her momentarily stunned.
<br><br>
Mia snapped the photo, then smirked. “Cute.”
<br><br>
As Mia walked away, Ria turned to Lex, her voice barely above a whisper. “What was that?”
<br><br>
“Keeping up appearances,” he replied, his expression unreadable.
<br><br>
But Ria couldn’t help noticing the faint pink tint on his ears.
<br><br>
That night, as they drove back to her apartment, Ria finally broke the silence.
<br><br>
“You were... good today,” she admitted reluctantly.
<br><br>
“Good?” Lex said, raising an eyebrow.
<br><br>
“Fine, great,” Ria muttered. “Don’t let it go to your head.”
<br><br>
Lex smirked, but said nothing.
<br><br>
As they pulled up to her building, Ria hesitated before getting out. “Thanks. For today.”
<br><br>
“Just doing my job,” Lex replied.
<br><br>
But as she climbed the stairs to her apartment, she couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d gone above and beyond.
`
    },
    {
        title: "Chapter 5",
        text: ` Ria didn’t expect the aftermath of the family gathering to linger in her mind, but it did. The image of Lex with her family, his arm around her for the photo, and the way he had smoothly handled her mom’s relentless questions—it all felt too real.
<br><br>
The problem? It wasn’t real.
<br><br>
And yet, here she was, staring at her phone the next morning, scrolling through Mia’s social media post. “Ria and Lex: Couple goals 💕.”
<br><br>
“Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me,” Ria groaned, tossing her phone onto the bed.
<br><br>
An Unexpected Call
The day passed in a blur of work, errands, and a failed attempt at ignoring her feelings. That evening, her phone buzzed.
<br><br>
Lex.
<br><br>
“Hello?” Ria said, trying to keep her voice casual.
<br><br>
“I need you to check your schedule,” Lex said, his tone brisk as usual.
<br><br>
“For what?”
<br><br>
“There’s another event.”
<br><br>
Ria frowned. “Another event? What are you talking about?”
<br><br>
“My sister’s engagement party,” Lex said, sounding like he was forcing the words out.
<br><br>
Ria blinked. “Wait, your sister? I thought we weren’t supposed to mix personal lives?”
<br><br>
“This wasn’t planned,” Lex replied. “She saw Mia’s post and assumed we’re serious.”
<br><br>
“Oh, great. So now I’m meeting your family?”
<br><br>
“Yes,” he said simply.
<br><br>
Ria opened her mouth to argue, but the sound of hesitation in his voice stopped her.
<br><br>
“Lex,” she said, softening, “is this... okay with you?”
<br><br>
“It’s necessary,” he replied, deflecting. “Will you do it or not?”
<br><br>
Ria sighed. “Fine. But you owe me. Big time.”
<br><br>
The engagement party was held at an upscale venue that screamed wealth and formality. Ria felt out of place as she stepped inside, wearing a borrowed cocktail dress and trying not to trip in her heels.
<br><br>
Lex was waiting by the entrance, dressed in a sharp black suit that made him look even more untouchable.
<br><br>
“You’re late,” he said, glancing at his watch.
<br><br>
“You’re welcome,” Ria shot back, ignoring the butterflies in her stomach.
<br><br>
He offered her his arm, and they walked in together, the picture-perfect couple.
<br><br>
Lex’s sister, Amelia, was a stunning woman with the same sharp features as her brother but a much warmer personality. She greeted them with open arms.
<br><br>
“Ria!” Amelia exclaimed, pulling her into a hug. “It’s so great to finally meet you. I’ve been hearing so much about you.”
<br><br>
Ria glanced at Lex, who looked like he wanted to disappear. “All good things, I hope?”
<br><br>
“Of course,” Amelia said, grinning. “He never shuts up about you.”
<br><br>
Lex cleared his throat. “Amelia.”
<br><br>
“What? It’s true!” Amelia teased, winking at Ria.
<br><br>
Ria couldn’t help but smile. She liked Amelia already.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
As the evening went on, Ria noticed the way people interacted with Lex. They were polite, even deferential, but there was an undercurrent of distance. Lex was clearly respected but not close to anyone here, not even Amelia.
<br><br>
“You don’t talk much about your family,” Ria said during a quiet moment.
<br><br>
Lex’s expression didn’t change, but his jaw tightened. “Because there’s not much to say.”
<br><br>
Ria hesitated, sensing the subject was a landmine. But before she could press further, someone called out, “Lex! Come over here.”
<br><br>
He turned to her. “I’ll be back in a minute.”
<br><br>
As Lex walked away, Amelia appeared at Ria’s side.
<br><br>
“Don’t take it personally,” Amelia said, sipping her champagne. “Lex has always been... guarded.”
<br><br>
“Yeah, I noticed,” Ria replied.
<br><br>
Amelia smiled sadly. “He wasn’t always like that. But things changed after... well, after everything that happened.”
<br><br>
Ria frowned. “What do you mean?”
<br><br>
Amelia hesitated. “It’s not my story to tell. But if you’re serious about him, just... be patient, okay? He needs someone like you.”
<br><br>
Before Ria could ask more, Amelia was swept away by another guest.
<br><br>
Breaking the Rules
Later that night, as they walked to the car, Ria couldn’t keep her curiosity at bay.
<br><br>
“Your sister is great,” she said, testing the waters.
<br><br>
“She’s tolerable,” Lex replied, unlocking the car.
<br><br>
Ria slid into the passenger seat, studying him. “She said you’ve been through a lot.”
<br><br>
Lex stiffened but didn’t reply.
<br><br>
“Look,” Ria said, softening her tone, “I know we have rules, but if you ever want to talk—”
<br><br>
“We’re not doing this,” Lex cut her off, his voice cold.
<br><br>
Ria flinched, the sharpness of his tone cutting deeper than she expected. “Fine. Forget I said anything.”
<br><br>
The rest of the drive was silent.
<br><br>
***
<br><br>
When they reached her apartment, Ria hesitated before getting out.
<br><br>
“Thanks for tonight,” she said, her voice subdued.
<br><br>
Lex nodded, his expression unreadable.
<br><br>
As she opened the door, he said, “Ria.”
<br><br>
She turned back, surprised.
<br><br>
“You were good with my sister,” he said quietly. “Thank you.”
<br><br>
Ria blinked, caught off guard by the sincerity in his voice. “You’re welcome.”
<br><br>
For a moment, their eyes met, and she thought she saw something unspoken flicker in his gaze. But then he looked away, and the moment was gone.
<br><br>
As she closed the door behind her, Ria couldn’t help but wonder: who was Lex, really? And why did she care so much about finding out?`
